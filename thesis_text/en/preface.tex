\section{Vector Screencast project}
A year ago two members of \"Khanova Å¡kola\", the czech brach of the Khan Academy, with an idea of improving the current technical solution of recording and displayling videos on their website. Their idea was not to capture classical bitmap-based videos, but rather a vector-based animation that could be scaled to any display resolution or edited in the future to improve quality of their videos, as some of videos recorded only a few years ago don't look nice or are't even well readable on large displays. The other extreme are small displays of tablets and smartphones where the downscaled letters are too small to read and can't be zoomed well in most video players.

One of the other reasons for this type of solution was the possible decrease of the size of data transfered over the Internet, as most of the image does not change between each two frames and very often the image doesn't change at all.
