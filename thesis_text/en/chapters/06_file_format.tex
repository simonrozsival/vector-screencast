\chapter{Vector Screencast file format}
What are the possibilities to encode the video.

\section{Audio}
Audio - standard Mp3 or Ogg Vorbis - I am not possibly able to come with something better.

\section{Video}
\subsection{Binary format}
Video - wrap into Matroska or WebM? What are the pros and cons?

\subsection{Text format}
This is only about the video.

\subsubsection{SVG}
- opensource standard for vector graphics.
Needs to be prerendered - I can't just specify sequence of points with pressures - I need to specify exactely the quadrilaterals - rendering method might change in the future.
No support for drawing-lines-like animation.

\subsubsection{Custom XML-based format}
Raw data in some sturctured file format, based on SVG or somehow wrapping SVG.

\section{Conclusion}
Which one I have chosen and why. Internal storage (MKV/WebM), immediate (XML)?
