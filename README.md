Vector Screencast Project
=========================

For a demo see [www.rozsival.com](http://www.rozsival.com)

To build the project, install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) first. Install *gulp* via `npm install -g gulp` command.
You might need to execute this command as super user. Then go to the root directory of the Vector Screencast Project
 and install all dependencies by running `npm install` command.
 
To build all components of the project, run the `gulp` command. To build only the library, run `gulp release`,
to build only demo components, run `gulp demo`. To generate API documentation from the source of the library,
run `gulp doc`. Documentation will be placed in the */doc* folder.
